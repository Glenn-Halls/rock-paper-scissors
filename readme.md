Rock, Paper, Scissors!

My first python project plays a game of rock, paper, scissors against different computer opponents with different strategies.  The game is best-of-three with an optional tie-breaker if this condition occurrs.

Usage:
press 1 or type rock to play ROCK
press 2 or type rock to play PAPER
press 3 or type rock to play SCISSORS

Good Luck!
