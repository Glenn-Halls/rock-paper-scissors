# Rock, Paper, Scissors!
##### My first python project plays a game of rock, paper, scissors against different computer opponents with different strategies.  The game is best-of-three with an optional tie-breaker if a tie occurrs.

<br>

### Select a computer opponent:
<ul>
  <li>1 - Rock Player - always plays rock</li>
  <li>2 - Random Player - randomly selects a move each turn</li>
  <li>3 - Reflect Player - mimicks your previous move, randomly selects move #1</li>
  <li>4 - Cycle Player - cycles through rock --> paper --> scissors, randomly selects move #1</li>
  <li>5 - Random Opponent - randomly selects from the players described above</li>
</ul>

### Usage:
<ul>
  <li> press 1 or type "rock" to play ROCK </li>
  <li> press 2 or type "paper" to play PAPER </li>
  <li> press 3 or type "scissors" to play SCISSORS </li>
</ul>

<br>

### Good Luck!
